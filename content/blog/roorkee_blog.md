What's better than spontaneously registering for a well-known Robotics tournament and thriving until the very last minute to be done with the making of our robot for it? That adrenaline rush is just what each of us craves. And that's precisely how we, A.T.O.M. Labs, started this journey. The A.T.O.M. Labs recently attended Cognizance, IIT Roorkee's prestigious annual technical festival, on a journey fuelled by creativity and fellowship. Our team found itself in the center of a flurry of robotics challenges, enthralling concerts, and exhilarating gaming tournaments as the best technical brains in the country converged. One of the best things was getting to work on different robotics projects and thinking out of the box to make every approach better than before.

##### Let's explore all these exciting projects in little depth now!
The first one being "ZenGrip" in which we were asked to pick-and-place obstacles, traversing the rough lanes. And in the heat of a gripping robotics challenge, our team devised a formidable solution: a manually controlled bot equipped with a state-of-the-art 3D-printed gripper, two powerful motors, Arduino Nano, and motor drivers. Through innovation and collaboration, we overcame hurdles, and honed our design.

##### How cool it would be to see mini mouse-like robots navigate through a maze!
 while trying it's best to not hit walls and that's exactly how the problem statement of "Nano Navigators" came to existence. Tasked with navigating intricate mazes in record time while minimizing collisions, we delved into an arena where every turn, every twist, presented a new puzzle to solve. Armed with a formidable array of sensors and components, including three ultrasonic sensors, four IR sensors, Arduino Uno, two motors, and a motor driver, our quest for perfection began. Despite initial setbacks with Flood Fill algorithm implementation, we pivoted to a left wall following strategy, harnessing the power of precise sensor data to guide our bot through labyrinthine corridors. With a chassis crafted from 3D-printed parts and acrylic sheet, our creation embodied resilience and agility, weaving through the maze with grace and precision.

But the most fun part would be integrating robotics into sports, and seeing robots face each other one on one, just like humans, Tug of war inspired "Plasma Pull", Soccer led to "Robo Soccer" and car race into "Evo Rush", all great examples of exciting competitions made this experience wholesome. Our projects for these competitions were as enriching and exciting as problem statements itself. For "Plasma pull", we took inspiration from big muskie of 1969 and came up with a mini version of it that consisted of 2 BLDC driven turbines and wired switches to have control over it, hence making it stand against the opponent effortlessly. During the"Evo Rush"challenge, we crafted a high-speed racing car utilizing BLDC motors, with its structure meticulously engineered using CAD software, and controlled seamlessly with a Flysky controller. And for "Robo Soccer" we built our solution with a four-wheel differential, turning wireless into wired for reliability. Using L298D Motor Drivers and sturdy motor mounts, we pieced it all together. Our shooting mechanism? Just a 3D-printed marvel. And the FlySky wireless controller, keeping everything in line.

##### At Cognizance, our team embraced the spirit of creativity, showcasing our robotics expertise across various competitions.
While we excelled in our chosen events, the diverse challenges pushed us to innovate and explore new realms of robotic technology. Beyond the technical arena, the event offered a vibrant tapestry of experiences, from electrifying concerts, be it “Sounds of India” by Amit Trivedi or EDM event by Ravator. Thrilling gaming challenges, to fostering camaraderie and collaboration among team members. Reflecting on our time at Cognizance, we recognize the invaluable personal and professional growth fostered by shared experiences and mentorship. Our journey underscores the transformative power of creativity and collaboration, inspiring us to continue pushing the boundaries of robotics and embracing new opportunities for innovation.
