In this session we are going to talk about our society and just give you guys a brief glimpse on what its about working at ATOM Robotics society. 

Some of our existing members are going to showcase the projects that they've built as a part of A.T.O.M and in the end we are going to talk about the selection task. We will also be joined by the good folks at [hatchnhack](https://hatchnhack.com) who will be talking about their makerspace and [hnhcart](https://hnhcart.com). Overall, it's going to be a blast. 

See you at 12:55 in the 4th Block Basement on 7th March the Monday
